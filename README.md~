# SK Creative Challange 2016
This is the repository for the code of the "male children" team participating in th SK Creative Challange 2016.

## Raspi
This folder contains all the relevant python files to run the ship robot. In order to start everything just run

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
python main.py
```

### Python classes

#### MazeControl.py
This program guides the ship through the maze by using ultrasonic sensors and sign detection.

#### MotorControl.py
This program controlls the two motors to drive straight, turn left and right or turn back.

#### SensorReader.py
This program will read out all the three ultrasonic sensors and also applies a median filter to the measurements.

#### SignDetector.py
This program performs computer vision algorithms to detect the signs in the maze.

#### SignDetector_demo.py
Demo program of the SignDetector, which is showing the output and plays sounds when detecting signs.

#### SignDetector_piCam.py
Same as the SignDetector.py but compatible with the Raspberry Pi camera.

#### classification.py
Helper class for the SignDetector. It compares the captured images with templates.


##DeepLearning
This folder contains all the code and learning data for creating an image classifier for signs in tensorflow.


##ROS
The ROS folder can be copied into your catkin workspace and will be built with 

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
catkin_make
```

### Packages

#### sign_detection 
This is a ROS node for detecting squares.

#### image_publisher 
Opens USB camera and publishes the images as a ROS message.


##PiFinder
This folder contains a simple program that helps finding the Raspberry Pi in the local network. It is taken from https://github.com/thoqbk/pi-oi.


##utils
some additional programs for testing, evaluation etc.
